This series adds the core support for kexec re-boot and kdump on ARM64.  This
version of the series combines Takahiro's kdump patches with my kexec patches.
Please consider all patches for inclusion.

I just tested all the endian combinations of kexec LE->LE, LE->BE, BE->BE,
BE->LE, and both LE an BE kdump, and all work as expected.

To load a second stage kernel and execute a kexec re-boot or to work with kdump
on ARM64 systems a series of patches to kexec-tools [2], which have not yet been
merged upstream, are needed.

To examine vmcore (/proc/vmcore), you should use
  - gdb v7.7 or later
  - crash v7.1.1 or later

Changes for v13 (Jan 15, 2016, 20m):

  o Rebase to Linux-4.4.
  o Remove align directive from cpu_reset.c.
  o Use inline C wrapper for cpu_soft_restart.
  o Revert the new image d-cache flush changes of v10.
  o Add SCTLR cleanup patch.
  o Change pr_devel to pr_debug.
  o Call flush_icache_range() for reboot_code_buffer.
  o Add .ltorg directive to arm64_relocate_new_kernel.
  o Make new asm macro copy_page.
  o Change cache maintenence from inner-shareable to non-shareable.
  o Rename KEXEC_ARCH_ARM64 to KEXEC_ARCH_AARCH64.

  o arm64: kvm: allows kvm cpu hotplug
    - remove some garbage code from kvm_host.h
  o arm64: kdump: reserve memory for crash dump kernel
    - change CONFIG_KEXEC to CONFIG_KEXEC_CORE
    - don't panic on crash kernel alloc failure
      (thanks to Mark Salter, RH)
  o arm64: kdump: implement machine_crash_shutdown()
    - change "boot/non-boot cpu" to "crashing/non-crashing cpu"
    - introduce is_in_crash_kexec() for readability
    - re-introduce machine_kexec_mask_interrupts(), as arch/arm has,
      to discard unexpected interrupts
    - call crash_save_cpu() before making cpus offline to avoid a possible race
      (thanks to Pratyush Anand/Mark Salter, RH)
  o arm64: kdump: update a kernel doc
    - clarify that we support "Image" format as well as vmlinux in kdump.txt
  o arm64: kdump: relax BUG_ON() if more than one cpus are still active
    - change a warning message at the failure of shooting down non-crahsing cpus
